### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My Name Is Apache


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on javascript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript

I have been a discord.js coder for well over an year and have gained a lot of experience making discord bots but now i want to expand my knowledge to other languages and other ways of using the code instead of just making discord.js bot
